### Project Description:
The goal of this project was to create a tax calulator with 
a dropdown menu and few buttons that allows a user to enter 
their filing status and income and in turn recieve their total 
tax amount and tax bracket percentage. This was acheived by editing 
the code provided and writing the equations for three out of 
four filing statuses.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this project I learned about nested decision making structures, 
    when one decision making statement contains a second decision making 
    statement. This allows the developer to save time by including two 
    requirements in one if/else or if statement instead of writing 
    unecessary code.
2. In this lesson I also learned more about global variables and how 
    it is good programming practice using var when declaring variables. 
    If var is not used the varibale is global meaning that it takes 
    precendence over any code not in a function with a varibale declared 
    in that function.
3. Another lesson I learned in this assignment is conditional statements 
    in general, which allow the developer to account for different decisions 
    in different situations. There are four different conditional statements 
    available to coders: if, else, else if, and switch.
